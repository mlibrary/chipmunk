    # A validator runs compile-time validations against a validatable object
    # passed to #valid? or #errors during run-time. Validations are created
    # with the DSL defined in this class via the ::validates method. Subclasses
    # should define their own initializers and instance variables to facilitate
    # run-time configuration of the validations. The validations themselves
    # are run in instance context via instance_exec.
